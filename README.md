# ManagingData
This is code that I wrote with the help of MIT | xPro that is used to search through an object full of data, to find certain salaries that meet certain requirements.
## Converting and Managing Data  
This is a project where I took a .json file and converted it to a .js file and created an object out of it.  With the help of MIT | xPro, I was able to edit the data inside and search through to find data that met certain specifications.  
### Installation
